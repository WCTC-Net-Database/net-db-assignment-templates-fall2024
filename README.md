## How to Use These Templates

1. **Explore the Assignment Folders**:
   - Each assignment has its own folder, named according to the assignment number and topic (e.g., `Assignment1`).

2. **Read the README in Each Assignment Folder**:
   - Every assignment folder contains a `README.md` file with specific instructions, objectives, and grading criteria for that assignment.

3. **Start Coding**:
   - Open the provided `Program.cs` and related files in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio).
   - Follow the instructions and implement the required functionality.

4. **Run the Tests (if available)**:
   - Some of the assignments includes a `Tests` folder with basic unit tests to help you verify your implementation.
   - You can run these tests using a testing framework like xUnit, which is integrated into the project.

5. **Submit Your Assignment**:
   - After completing the assignment, push your code to the GitHub Classroom repository assigned to you.
   - Make sure your code is well-documented and passes all the provided tests (where applicable) before submission.

## Guidelines for Success

- **Start Early**: Begin working on your assignments as soon as they are available to avoid last-minute stress.
- **Ask for Help**: If you encounter any issues or have questions, don’t hesitate to ask during class, on the Canvas discussion board, or during office hours.
- **Write Clean Code**: Follow best practices for coding, including proper indentation, commenting, and naming conventions.
